taking fewer time, which is quite fast.\n","\n","Given 900 data points to predict 100 data points on slope calculation task, Chronos Bolt_base is much better than the other two models, though difference between Bolt_mini and Bolt_base is not that significant, especially if we consider MSE difference as shown in plot above; however, Bolt_small model gives relatively poor results throughout the 100 time series.\n","\n","Notice that since we add trend and noise to the original data, signals and noises from the original time series are exaggerated in this sense, and of course magnitude of data gets larger.\n","\n","Such intricate situation may be due to the following: Bolt_mini has much fewer parameters, but maybe it's just enough to capture the essential pattern in time series data here; while Bolt_base can capture the pattern in the data much better due to more powerful forecasting capabilities; but number of parameters for Bolt_small is between the previous two, maybe it's trying to capture all the complexities in the data but it's out of its capability, which may lead to poor performance.\n","\n","But still, the performance is quite good, especially for
